Design a clean, modern, interactive portfolio website for **Abdulrahman Mahnashi**. 
Base the content ONLY on his CV, keep the text short and simple, but make the UI visually rich with smooth animations and interactive elements.

================================
1) STYLE & COLOR SYSTEM
================================
• Light modern theme (not plain white).
• Use soft, fresh, futuristic colors:
  - Background: #F4F7FB (cloud blue-gray)
  - Primary: #5A7DFE (lavender blue)
  - Secondary: #8A95FF (soft purple)
  - Accent: #4CC9F0 (aqua blue)
  - Text: #1E293B (slate)
• Soft shadows, rounded edges, glass-like cards.

================================
2) INTERACTIVITY & ANIMATION (VERY IMPORTANT)
================================
Add smooth, premium animations such as:

• Hero section:
  - Text fade-in + slight upward motion
  - Subtle animated background shapes (floating circles or gradients)
  - Smooth scale-on-hover for buttons

• Section transitions:
  - Fade + slide animation when scrolling into each section
  - Staggered card animations for Skills, Projects, Experience

• Projects:
  - Cards lift slightly on hover (3D feel)
  - Tech stack chips animate in (fade/slide)
  - Subtle hover glow on edges

• Skills:
  - Chips with interaction (hover color change + small bounce)
  - Category titles slide in from left

• Experience:
  - Cards animate in from alternating sides
  - Icons pulse softly on hover

• Contact:
  - Inputs highlight with a glowing border on focus
  - Submit button has a soft hover animation

Animations should be:
• Smooth
• Fast (200–350ms)
• Professional, not cartoonish

================================
3) CONTENT (SHORT LIKE CV)
================================
Use ONLY minimal text based on the CV.

=========================
HERO SECTION
=========================
• Name: **Abdulrahman Mahnashi**
• Title: **Data & AI Engineer**
• One short sentence:
  "Building AI models and modern ELT pipelines."
• Buttons:
  - “Projects”
  - “Download CV”
• Animated background shapes (subtle, floating)

=========================
ABOUT SECTION
=========================
Use bullet points, not paragraphs:

• CS Graduate (AI Track) — 2025  
• Experience in AI, ML, GenAI  
• Skilled in Python, SQL, dbt, Snowflake  
• Worked on AI models + ELT pipelines  
• Based in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia  

Add a soft left-to-right animation for bullets.

=========================
SKILLS (Interactive Grid)
=========================
Show as animated chips/cards:

Programming: Python, SQL, Java  
AI & ML: TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-learn, LLMs  
Data Engineering: dbt, Snowflake, ETL/ELT, Kimball Modeling  
Data Science: Pandas, NumPy, Power BI  
Tools: Flask, Git/GitHub, APIs, Jupyter  

Chips should lift slightly + glow on hover.

=========================
EXPERIENCE (Short Cards)
=========================
Each card includes title + company + one-line summary:

• NOZOM — AI & Data Engineering Intern  
  “Supported AI models and dbt + Snowflake pipelines.”

• STC — AI & Data Analytics Trainee  
  “Automated analytics and prepared ML datasets.”

• Fada Tech Initiative — Tech & Innovation Leader  
  “Led AI and tech community projects.”

• GDSC — Technical Project Management Member  
  “Coordinated student AI projects.”

Cards animate into view with alternating slide directions.

=========================
PROJECTS (3–5 Cards)
=========================
Use animated hover effects + stacked fade-in animation.

1) MQSD – AI Trip Planner  
   “LLM-based itinerary generator.”  
   Tech: Python, Flask, OpenAI

2) Modern Data Pipeline (dbt + Snowflake)  
   “Raw → staging → marts ELT modeling.”  
   Tech: dbt, Snowflake, SQL

3) Heart Disease Prediction  
   “ML risk prediction model.”

Project cards should float slightly on hover with shadow expansion.

=========================
CONTACT SECTION
=========================
Keep simple and animated:

• Inputs with glow border on focus  
• Light floating icons for GitHub + LinkedIn  
• Button hover animation (scale + glow)
