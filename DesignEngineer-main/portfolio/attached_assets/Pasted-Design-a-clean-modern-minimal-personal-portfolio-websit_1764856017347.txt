Design a clean, modern, minimal personal portfolio website for **Abdulrahman Mahnashi** (Data & AI Engineer). 
The design must be very simple, lightweight, and not overloaded with text. 
Use only essential information similar to a CV, with short sections and clean spacing.

==========================
1) OVERALL STYLE
==========================
• Use a **light theme** (white + light gray background).
• Color palette:

  - Neutrals: #F5F7FA (background), #1E293B (text)
  - Accent: #FFA726 (soft warm orange)
• Layout: very minimal, lots of white space, no heavy graphics.
• Keep everything simple and elegant like Apple's website but lighter.
• Rounded cards, soft shadows, no gradients unless extremely subtle.
