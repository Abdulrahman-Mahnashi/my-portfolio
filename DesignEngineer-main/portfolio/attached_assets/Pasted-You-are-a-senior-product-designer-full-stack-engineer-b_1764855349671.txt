You are a senior product designer + full-stack engineer building a **completely custom, non-template** personal portfolio in Lovable.dev.

⚠️ IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS
- Do NOT use any typical Lovable layout or preset. No generic centered hero + 3-column cards.
- Design a **distinctive, premium portfolio** that feels like a crafted product, not a template.
- Stack: Next.js (or React), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion (or similar) for animations.
- The site must be fully responsive (mobile-first, then tablet, then desktop).
- Language: main content in EN. Prepare the structure so Arabic can be added later (by centralizing all strings in a simple translation object).

========================================
1) PERSONA & BRAND
========================================

Build this portfolio for:

Name: **Abdulrahman Mahnashi**  
Title: **Data & AI Engineer | Machine Learning & Modern Data Pipelines**  
Location: Riyadh, Saudi Arabia  
Email: **abdalrhmanmanashny@gmail.com**  
Phone: **+966532112101**  
GitHub: **https://github.com/Abdulrahman-Mahnashi**  
LinkedIn: **https://www.linkedin.com/in/abdulrahman-mahnashi**  

Short bio (use this almost verbatim, you may slightly polish phrasing but keep meaning):

> I’m Abdulrahman Mahnashi, a Data & AI Engineer specializing in modern data pipelines, ELT workflows, and AI-powered applications. I combine dbt, Snowflake, SQL, and Python to deliver analysis-ready datasets, and integrate Machine Learning and Generative AI (LLMs) to turn governed data into real, actionable insights. I enjoy building scalable systems, solving complex problems, and applying AI and data engineering to create meaningful impact.

Abdulrahman is:
- CS graduate (2025) with AI track.
- Experienced with dbt, Snowflake, ETL/ELT, Kimball modeling, Power BI, ML, and LLM/GenAI.
- Intern / trainee at NOZOM and STC.
- Active in community initiatives (Fada Tech, GDSC, youth volunteering).

========================================
2) VISUAL STYLE & THEME
========================================

Goal: **premium, calm, data-driven aesthetic** that looks like a modern SaaS landing page for a data & AI engineer, not like a typical “developer portfolio”.

Design directives:

- Default theme: **dark, soft and minimal**, with subtle gradients and glassmorphism.
- Color palette:
  - Background: #020617 (very dark navy)
  - Surface / cards: #020617 with glassmorphism (border + blur) or #020617 → #0F172A
  - Primary Accent: #3A86FF (electric blue)
  - Secondary Accent: #22C55E (green) for “data health / quality” visual.
  - Supporting Accent: #F97316 (warm orange) for CTAs and small details.
  - Text main: #E5E7EB (light gray), headers: #F9FAFB (near white).
- Use gradients like:
  - `background: radial-gradient(circle at top left, rgba(58,134,255,0.35), transparent 55%), radial-gradient(circle at bottom right, rgba(34,197,94,0.25), transparent 55%);`
- Background elements:
  - Subtle node/graph or network visual hinting at data pipelines and AI graphs.
  - No heavy stock illustrations. Prefer abstract shapes and data-inspired patterns.
- Typography:
  - Heading font: e.g., “Space Grotesk” or “Sora” (bold, geometric).
  - Body font: e.g., “Inter”.
  - Large, confident headings with tight line-height, generous negative space.

Micro-interactions:
- Soft hover on cards (translateY, slight scale, subtle shadow).
- Framer Motion for:
  - Hero text slide/fade.
  - Cards entering with staggered animation.
  - Section titles with underline animations.

========================================
3) GLOBAL LAYOUT & ROUTING

- Location: Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.
- Links: GitHub, LinkedIn buttons.

Form fields:
- Name (required)
- Email (required)
- Company / Organization (optional)
- What do you want to work on? (multi-line textarea)
- Simple anti-spam (e.g., “What is 2 + 3?”)

The form doesn’t need real backend wiring; just simulate success with a toast.

========================================
12) FOOTER
========================================

Minimal footer:
- Left: “© {currentYear} Abdulrahman Mahnashi. Data & AI Engineer.”
- Right: small text: “Built with ♥ using a modern data & AI stack mindset.”

========================================
13) IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
========================================

- Use Tailwind for all styling; set up a theme file (or config) with the color palette and spacing scale.
- Create reusable components: `Section`, `Card`, `Tag`, `Timeline`, `ProjectCard`, `SkillChip`, etc.
- Centralize all content into a `content` or `data` folder (e.g., `experience.ts`, `projects.ts`) so it is easy to maintain.
- Prepare a simple i18n-ready structure:
  - e.g., `const copy = { en: { ... }, ar: { ... } }` even if only `en` is filled for now.
- Ensure good accessibility: semantic HTML, aria-labels, focus states, sufficient contrast.
- Verify responsive behavior on 3 sizes: mobile (≤640px), tablet (~768–1024px), desktop (≥1280px).

Finally:
- Make the overall feel **exclusive, minimal, and product-grade**, not like a typical developer portfolio or a standard Lovable preset.
- Every section must clearly communicate Abdulrahman’s identity as a **Data & AI Engineer who owns the full journey: data → pipelines → models → insights**.
